              <p class="paragraph-2">I found my love for math pretty late. In high school, I just about failed calculus. My goal was to be a video game designer, so I decided to major in computer science. But upon enrolling in the requisite first year course in proofs and discrete math, I learned that math was way more creative than advertised. I switched to a sort of Math/CS double major in my second year and have been hooked ever since. </p>

              <h4 class="heading-4">University of Toronto</h4>
              <p class="paragraph-3">Grad school was the first place I started to falter - as an undergrad I was a pretty strong student. At U of T, my classmates were a much stronger bunch and the demands of my courses were pretty high. But through these new challenges, I made great friends and managed to find my way. I had always been interested in number theory. A first year analysis sequence taught by Larry Guth steered me toward harmonic analysis. So I went into analytic number theory, mentored by John Friedlander. At the same time, Leo Goldmakher was a postdoc U of T, and he tipped me off to the amazing field of additive combinatorics. This flavour of math was everything I had ever wanted to study, but John wasn&#x27;t an expert in the area (though he was wonderfully supportive), so I would have to pick it up on my own. The theorems I proved in my thesis were the result of me trying to understand new ideas or objects in the area.  </p>

              <p class="paragraph-4">Leaving grad school was tough. There was an amazing bond with my cohort that came from grinding it out together as students. And State College, PA is a pretty radical change of scene from Toronto. However, Bob Vaughan, my postdoc mentor, made the transition worthwhile. We found some common ground in trying to understand the <em>gaps between sums of squares</em>. At the same time, the ability to work independently helped me come into my own research wise. <br><br>An<em> inverse theorem for the distinct distance problem in cartesian products</em> was one of the first results I was truly proud of. When I started thinking about the problem I had no idea how to approach it. Being able to see it through was my first indication that I might be able to hack it as a researcher. </p>

              <p class="paragraph-5">Landing an permanent position in academia was hard, and I was going to have to do another lap of the postdoc track. Fortunately, I had friends in the UGA arithmetic combinatorics group and an amazing wife who was willing to support my academic dream. I spent a lot of time at UGA working with Giorgis Petridis and we proved a pair of results that I am really proud of.</p>

            <p class="paragraph-7">My work focuses on questions that have an equidistribution-theoretic flavour. These tend to lie somewhere in the realm of number theory, combinatorics and harmonic analysis, which combine to form an area of math now referred to as <em>discrete analysis</em>. <br><br>The predominant notion that I cling to in my research is the <em>structure versus randomness dichotomy</em>. Basically, this means that a collection of data points either exhibits patterns (structured), or it doesn&#x27;t (random). Usually, I&#x27;ll aim to prove that data sets with certain properties appear random from some perspective (a sort of equidistribution theorem). Other times, I&#x27;ll try to prove that a data set which does not appear random has to be generated by some reasonably simple means (a sort of  inverse theorem).<br><br>Below are some of the publications which exemplify my research program.
